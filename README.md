# RuleEngineChallenge

This has been developed as a console Application. This application will return a list of invalid data on colnsole application. 
Ruleset and raw datajson has been kept under Input_Data folder. 
In ruleset when value type is 0 then it means it checks for LOW signal. When it is 1 then it checks for high signal. 
For value type datetime, by default it is null. 
This means it will compare against current date. If a valid datetime is specified then check will happen against that date.
